About Me
```

Hi, I am `Error257` and I am a Programmer, not for aptitudes, I certainly have a long way to go, but I am a Programmer since I attempt to get it how 
things work, and I attempt to progress them, whether it is an working framework, a program or an protest that I utilize everyday. 
My thinks about are primarily almost Working Frameworks, Infiltration Testing and Organizing, I like to think about an working framework, 
or a framework in common, and unravel its security issues. I utilize nearly solely GNU/Linux Working Frameworks, and I have been an Curve Linux client for a long time.
Manjaro Linux has driven me to know the KISS rule, which I attempt to apply in programming and in issue fathoming, basic concept but exceptionally complex to ace.
